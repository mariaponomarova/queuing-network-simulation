    "For λ up to around 9, the system handles all arrivals smoothly, so throughput roughly matches λ and response times stay low. However, once λ reaches 10 or higher, response times start to explode while throughput stays around 10 jobs per unit time. This happens because the CPU is the bottleneck. In fact, every job must go through it first, and it can only process about 10 jobs per unit time on average. The disks don’t limit throughput, since there are two working in parallel and their combined capacity is higher than what the CPU can feed them. From this, we can conclude that the maximum sustainable throughput of the system is roughly 10 jobs per unit time, because adding more arrivals beyond this point only increases waiting times, not throughput."

    "We measured the average response times for three arrival rates using both disk policies. For the single-queue policy, the average response times were 0.256 for λ=3, 0.497 for λ=7, and 1.233 for λ=9. Using the shortest-queue policy, the response times were slightly lower: 0.245 for λ=3, 0.452 for λ=7, and 0.991 for λ=9. This shows that distributing jobs to the disk with the shorter queue helps reduce waiting times, especially as the load increases. At low arrival rates (λ=3), both policies perform almost the same because the system is lightly loaded, but at higher rates (λ=9), the shortest-queue policy clearly improves response times by balancing the load more efficiently between the fast and slow disks."
